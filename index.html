<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: [insert date]</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how our application Mutauro wangu collects, uses, and protects information. The App is designed for educational purposes and may be used by children under 13. We comply with Google Play’s Families Policy Requirements and ensure high standards of privacy and safety.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
<p>The App does not require users to create an account and does not ask for personal information such as name, email, phone number, or address.</p>

<h3>b. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<p>The App may collect limited, non-personal technical data to improve functionality, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Device type and model</li>
    <li>Operating system version</li>
    <li>App crash logs</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>This information cannot identify a specific user.</p>

<h3>c. Children's Data</h3>
<p>The App does not collect, store, or request any personal information from children. No location data, photos, contacts, or audio are accessed.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
<p>Any collected non-personal data is used only to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Improve app performance</li>
    <li>Fix bugs</li>
    <li>Enhance user experience</li>
    <li>Understand general usage patterns</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App may use the following services:</p>

<h3>a. Google Play Services</h3>
<p>Used for essential app functionality and stability reporting.</p>

<h3>b. Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics (if used)</h3>
<p>If enabled, these tools collect anonymous analytics and crash data. They do not collect personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>c. Advertising</h3>
<p>The App does not display targeted advertising to children. If ads are added in the future, only Google-approved, family-safe ads will be used.</p>

<h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, share, or disclose user information to third parties except when:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>
    <li>Operating and maintaining the App</li>
    <li>Working with trusted providers such as Google Play Services</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect all collected data. Because only non-personal information is collected, risk is minimized—especially for children.</p>

<h2>7. Parental Rights</h2>
<p>Parents or guardians may:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request deletion of data collected through third-party services</li>
    <li>Review how their child’s data is used</li>
    <li>Contact us for privacy concerns</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. External Links</h2>
